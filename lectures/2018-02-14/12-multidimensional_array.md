# Multidimensional Array

https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/multidimensional-array

A 2D array is an array of arrays.

**Note** that each array element doesn't have to have the same length.

A 3D array is an array of arrays of arrays, or an array of 2D arrays.

A 4D array is an array of arrays of arrays of arrays, or an array of 3D arrays.

Theoretically there should be no limit in the number of dimensions. (If you are interested, take a look at [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4060538/maximum-number-of-dimensions-in-a-java-array).)
